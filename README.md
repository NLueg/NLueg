### Hi there, my name is Nico 👋

I am 24 years old and employed as an Software Engineer.
I am very into everything that's web-related like Angular, TypeScript and JavaScript. 
I mainly use Node.JS for my backend-systems but I also speak some Java :coffee:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my app made with Ionic & Angular - [Pantrist](https://pantrist.com)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some React that I don't only know Angular as a frontend framework
- 👯 I’m always to collaborate on cool Open Source projects. Currently I mainly collaborate on projects that are related to Ionic & Capacitor.
