### Hi there, my name is Nico ðŸ‘‹

... and I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer.
I am into everything that's web-related like Angular, TypeScript and JavaScript. 
I mainly use Node.JS for my backend-systems but I also speak some Java and Kotlin :coffee:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some React to get some broader experience in frontend development. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always open to collaborate on cool Open Source projects. Currently I mainly collaborate on projects that are related to Ionic & Capacitor.
